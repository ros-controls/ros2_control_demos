****************
Example 1: RRBot
****************


*RRBot*, or ''Revolute-Revolute Manipulator Robot'', is a simple 3-linkage, 2-joint arm that we will use to demonstrate various features.
It is essentially a double inverted pendulum and demonstrates some fun control concepts within a simulator and was originally introduced for Gazebo tutorials.
The *RRBot* URDF files can be found in the ``description/urdf`` folder.

1. To check that *RRBot* descriptions are working properly use following launch commands

   .. code-block:: shell

    ros2 launch ros2_control_demo_example_1 view_robot.launch.py

   **NOTE**: Getting the following output in terminal is OK: ``Warning: Invalid frame ID "odom" passed to canTransform argument target_frame - frame does not exist``.
   This happens because ``joint_state_publisher_gui`` node need some time to start.
   The ``joint_state_publisher_gui`` provides a GUI to change the configuration for rrbot. It is immediately displayed in *RViz*.

2. To start *RRBot* example open a terminal, source your ROS2-workspace and execute its launch file with

   .. code-block:: shell

    ros2 launch ros2_control_demo_example_1 rrbot.launch.py

   The launch file loads and starts the robot hardware, controllers and opens *RViz*.
   In starting terminal you will see a lot of output from the hardware implementation showing its internal states.
   This is only of exemplary purposes and should be avoided as much as possible in a hardware interface implementation.

   If you can see two orange and one yellow rectangle in in *RViz* everything has started properly.
   Still, to be sure, let's introspect the control system before moving *RRBot*.

3. Check if the hardware interface loaded properly, by opening another terminal and executing

   .. code-block:: shell

    ros2 control list_hardware_interfaces

   .. code-block:: shell

    command interfaces
          joint1/position [available] [claimed]
          joint2/position [available] [claimed]
    state interfaces
          joint1/position
          joint2/position

   Marker ``[claimed]`` by command interfaces means that a controller has access to command *RRBot*.

4. Check is controllers are running by

   .. code-block:: shell

    ros2 control list_controllers

   .. code-block:: shell

    joint_state_broadcaster[joint_state_broadcaster/JointStateBroadcaster] active
    forward_position_controller[forward_command_controller/ForwardCommandController] active

5. If you get output from above you can send commands to *Forward Command Controller*, either:

   a. Manually using ros2 cli interface:

   .. code-block:: shell

    ros2 topic pub /position_commands std_msgs/msg/Float64MultiArray "data:
    - 0.5
    - 0.5"

   B. Or you can start a demo node which sends two goals every 5 seconds in a loop

   .. code-block:: shell

    ros2 launch ros2_control_demo_example_1 test_forward_position_controller.launch.py

   You should now see orange and yellow blocks moving in *RViz*.
   Also, you should see changing states in the terminal where launch file is started, e.g.

   .. code-block:: shell

    [RRBotSystemPositionOnlyHardware]: Got command 0.50000 for joint 0!
    [RRBotSystemPositionOnlyHardware]: Got command 0.50000 for joint 1!
